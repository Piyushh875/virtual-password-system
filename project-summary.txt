Virtual Password System: Comprehensive Summary
Purpose of the Website
The Virtual Password System is designed to provide military-grade security for user authentication through a unique PIN-based system. Its primary purposes are:

Enhanced Security: Replace traditional password-only systems with a two-factor authentication approach

Cryptographic Protection: Ensure user credentials are never stored in plain text

User Convenience: Eliminate the need to remember complex passwords

Admin Oversight: Provide administrators with tools to manage user access securely

Phishing Prevention: Protect against credential theft through dynamic PIN generation

How the System Works
1. User Registration
Users provide personal details and create a password

System checks password strength and ensures username uniqueness

Registration details are stored locally with "pending" status

2. Admin Approval
Administrator reviews and approves new registrations

Upon approval, the system generates a virtual PIN based on the user's password

PIN is securely emailed to both user and admin

3. User Login Process
User enters credentials (username/password)

System verifies credentials against stored data

User is prompted to enter the virtual PIN sent to their email

Upon successful PIN verification, access is granted

4. PIN Verification
PIN is valid only for the current session

Users can request PIN resend if needed

Incorrect PIN entries trigger security alerts

Password Conversion Algorithm
The system uses a sophisticated 5-step cryptographic process to convert passwords to virtual PINs:
Algorithm Components:
SHA-256 Hashing: Creates a fixed-size hash from the password

Cryptographic Salt: Random data added to each password before hashing

Secret Pepper: Application-level secret added to all hashes

PIN Generation: Creates 6-digit code from hashed values

Key Stretching: Repeated hashing to prevent brute-force attacks

Security Protocols
Data Encryption: All sensitive data is encrypted in localStorage

Session Management: Current user sessions are securely managed

Two-Factor Authentication: Password + PIN verification

Secure Communication: EmailJS with TLS encryption

No Plaintext Storage: Passwords are never stored in readable format
